# Lit MVC

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/allibubba/lit/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/allibubba/lit)

### About
This is a personal project to build a functional MVC with modern PHP.

### Template language
Went with [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for its clean syntax and ease of use.


### DB
[Doctrine 2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html), I felt like Doctrine had  the right level of features and documentation for this project.

### Directory Structure
 WIP
